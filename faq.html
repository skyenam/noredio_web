                  <div class="answer">
                     Noredio is a music streaming and distribution platform that focuses on AI-generated songs. 
                     Our platform allows users to generate personalized AI songs based on their preferences, 
                     and we ensure that the artists receive credit and revenue from the use of their content. 
                     Listeners can also purchase copyrights directly through the app, enabling them to use and 
                     share the music freely on other platforms.

                     How does Noredio handle copyright acquisition for AI-generated music?
                  </div>
                  <div class="answer">
                     Noredio simplifies the process of copyright acquisition by allowing users to purchase the 
                     copyrights for AI-generated songs directly within the app. 
                     This makes it easy for listeners to legally download and share music on various platforms,
                     while ensuring that artists are fairly compensated for their work.

                  <div class="answer">
                     Artists on Noredio benefit from multiple revenue streams, 
                     including a share of the revenue from music streams and downloads, as well as fees for content uploads 
                     that are used to generate the AI songs. This not only provides artists with a new way to monetize their work 
                     but also ensures that they receive proper credit and compensation when their music is used by content creators.
